2048clone, or  "?Confuse-48?", was supposed to be a variant of the popular game 2048.
The main idea from the beginning was to experiment with the gameplay experience of the game by inverting the board about the center.
This would be accomplished by dividing the original 4x4 board into 4 2x2 corners, and connecting the top left corner of the interface
board with the bottom right corner of the logical board. The goal was to have animations and basic gameplay functionality confuse
the player by having sliding animations lead values of the board/screen.

I have written about all of this in terms of "wanted" because, in reality, very little of this was successfully implemented.
I mostly blame my own time management. I didn't start on this immediately, so I had a lot of catching up to do when I began working.
Then, I was unsure of how complex I would have to make it. I spent one day implementing some code for frame rate management across multiple
threads, but I later determined this was unnecessary and removed it. I wasted valuable time on nonessential components, so I was in an even worse
state. Ultimately, it was my fault that this project turned out this way and, in the future, I aim to spend far more time developing my projects.
